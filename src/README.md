# Radical Data Structure

1. A Radical layer contains a region and a set of strokes. The set of strokes divides the region into small radical Layers.

2. When we add a stroke into a radical layer:

    * we don't specify the length of stroke.
      The length is defined by the area and shape of region.

    * we dont't specify the position of stroke.
      The centroid of stroke is aligned to the centroid of region.
